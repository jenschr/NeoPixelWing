# NeoPixelWing
Simple FeatherWing for controlling two strands of NeoPixels. It's basically just a 2-channel level shifter with two Potmeters, but very useful for lighting projects.

If you want to create your own FeatherWing, feel fre to use the bare project that I setup this project from as a verified starting point: https://github.com/jenschr/FeatherWing Big thanks to Adafruit for making the Feather format!

Please note: The Project is in Kicad 5 format. If you still use kicad 4 - I highly recommend swapping! V5 is better than V4 in so many ways.
