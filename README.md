# NeoPixelWing
Simple FeatherWing for controlling two strands of NeoPixels. It's basically just a 2-channel level shifter with two Potmeters, but very useful for lighting projects.

If you want to create your own FeatherWing, feel fre to use the bare project that I setup this project from as a verified starting point: https://github.com/jenschr/FeatherWing
